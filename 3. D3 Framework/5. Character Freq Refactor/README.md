When a phrase is typed, a chart is shown below showing how many times the letter appears

upon typing a second phrase, it compares how many new characters in the new phrase there are based on the old phrase. (new phrase are colored differently)

reset button clears the graph area.

This is a refactoring of 3. Character frequency this time using SVG and D3 instead of D3 only with css.
