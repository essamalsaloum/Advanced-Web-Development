# Advanced-Web-Development

This Project is used to code along with Colt's Udemy course on (Advanced Web Development)[https://www.udemy.com/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/content].

The sections are split into

1. Everything in the root folder is either Code Along examples, or Exercises given during the course. The folders have README files describing what the requirements are for each exercise.
1. Practice contains code that I implemented during the course of the code to test how the specific component works.
